        <h3>My Favorite Mobile application</h3>
        <p>
            My favorite mobile application in the past was facebook. I was really astonished by the idea of connecting people all around the world through the internet and sharing the thoughts and images they took an online platform. 
            Also, Facebook allows people to connect with friends and chat with them. All this together in a single web application was a historical change in the internet. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now Instagram a new platform that is more fun and interactive has taken over the world. Instagram is my new favorite Mobile application. It has been developing new features that allow people to do marketing, and showcase their different skills to the world.
            It is more attractive and user-friendly to use. But the drawback would be the most addictive social media platform to exist.
